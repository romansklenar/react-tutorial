# React Tutorial

This is the React comment box example from [the React tutorial](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html).

## To use

There are several simple server implementations included. They all serve static files from `public/` and handle requests to `comments.json` to fetch or add data. Start a server with following command:

### Ruby
```sh
ruby server.rb
```

And visit <http://localhost:3000/>. Try opening multiple tabs!
